## Testing Checklist

- Validate that the worker responds with the expected HTML message:
  - HTTP Method: GET
  - Expected HTML body: '<h1>Hello, Cloudflare Worker!</h1>'
  - Status Code: 200
- Ensure the worker correctly handles other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) by returning an appropriate response (405 Method Not Allowed).
- Test for different HTTP methods to confirm the worker doesn't accept anything other than GET.
- Simulate errors in processing to ensure 'Internal Server Error' (500) is returned appropriately.
- Validate behavior with malformed requests to check input validation.
- Check for proper handling of large headers or unexpected query parameters.
