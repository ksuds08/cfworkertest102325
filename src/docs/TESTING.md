# Testing Guidelines

## Deployment Tests

New unit tests have been added in `src/tests/deployment.test.ts` to verify the core functionality of the deployment script. These tests primarily check if the deployment status updates work correctly, which is crucial for the deployment processes.

### Test Cases Covered
- Validating correct status update for a deployment

### Future Work
- Error handling and edge cases should be incorporated in later phases.
