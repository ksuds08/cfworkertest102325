## Documentation Updates

### Type Definitions
Added types and interfaces for `WorkerRequest` and `WorkerResponse` in the `src/types.ts` file. These will help streamline request and response handling in the Cloudflare Worker.

### Testing Recommendations
- Test that the worker responds with the expected HTML message.
- Validate that the worker correctly handles different HTTP methods and status codes.
